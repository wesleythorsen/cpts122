The function descriptions make the code kinda long so:
CTRL + M + O  -  collapse all sections
CTRL + M + L  -  expand all sections


Look at the "include_diagram.png" and the "Measurments.png" pictures in the file pa8_v2 file.
They will explain some stuff.

Other notes:

Once we have a menu system, every time the game begins a new _player should be initialized
and the old _player should be deleted (after there score is saved to a .txt file of some sort).
